# sphinx-checker
Checking basic documentation consistencies. [PyDocStyle](http://pydocstyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/error_codes.html) is great, but it only
 covers stylistic minimums. The contents of the documentation should be checked
 as well. This is where `sphinx-checker` comes in. Or should come in once
 I finish writing it...

Basic check:
- Make sure all arguments are documented and match the fuction signature


Nengo-specific check:
- Make sure the param system is being used properly.
